# Building a Deep Learning Network

This repo contains problem sets for a deep learning class taken at Northwestern University. Datasets are not included in the repo - please let me know if you would like to see them.

### Creating a deep learning library
[dl_lib](hw3/dl_lib) contains a deep learning library with a fully functional user interface to implement a neural network classifier. Check out the directory to learn more about how to use it.
